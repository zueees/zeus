## 🎨 Customize it your way
If you want to change the **music**, **background**, or **cursor**, just replace the corresponding files in the `assets/` folder.
Make sure to keep the **same file format** (e.g. `.mp3`, `.png`, `.mp4`) to avoid issues.

You can fully edit the script, change styles, add features, or fix bugs — go wild.
Have fun creating your own version!

## 🛠 How to use
Just open `index.html` in your browser with a live server. No setup required.

## 🎨 Add Your Own Assets

To keep this repository lightweight, no music, videos, fonts, or GIFs are included.

If you want your site to work and look like the preview, you need to **add your own media files** (from YouTube, music libraries, etc.) into the `assets/` folder using the **exact same filenames and formats** listed below.

This is just a simplified setup — feel free to change the filenames, add more, or completely rewrite the script to match your own style and preferences.
